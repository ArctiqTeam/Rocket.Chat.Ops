# Integrate with Rocket.Chat !

Integrate your apps with Rocket.Chat.   Powered by Hubot.

## Chat-ops is NOW CORE!

We are delighted to announce that Chat-ops is now part of core.  See [core repository](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat) for future development.

This repository will showcase a collection of Hubot and Meteor Packages that you can use in your own integrations!

## Hubots 

We have been testing our GitHub and GitLab integration hubots for months on our 
[community chat server](https://demo.rocket.chat/).

Meet *Baron Bogo*!   Our [GitHub integration hubot](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Ops/tree/develop/hubots/hubot-baronbogo).

Meet *Gitsy* !   Our [GitLab integration hubot](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Ops/tree/develop/hubots/hubot-gitsy).

Meet *Raffie* !  Our _baby_ AI frontier exploration learning hubot.  Backed by [A.L.I.C.E.](http://www.alicebot.org/about.html) on the mother side, and [Watson](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/services-catalog.html) on the other, will Raffie grow up to be the genius that make his parents proud?   Stay tuned - coming soon.


## Meteor Packages 
* Drone Fleet Management ([mock proof-of-concept demo](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Ops/tree/develop/packages/rocketchat-chatops))


### Old Chat-ops information

100% powered by hubot.

Main features:

* flexible fly-in panels that can contain arbitrary user interface
* scalable inbound event handling
* scalable outbound command dispatching
* inbound data rendered by specialized widgets on fly-ins (example: code is rendered in syntax highlighed text editor)
* real time feeds, connected by chat fabric, p2p direct data stream from source <--> sinks into UI widget(s) on fly-ins
* modular, non-intrusive, integration with the mainstream Rocket.Chat core
* bots backwards compatible with Rocket.Chat core
* extension is per-room customizable, for example: one room for open source project Rocket.Chat developers via github integration, another for MineCraft server farms operators discussion and network monitoring, yet another for a drone delivery service's fleet monitoring and control (see screenshot below)
