100% powered by hubot.

Main features:

* flexible fly-in panels that can contain arbitrary user interface
* scalable inbound event handling
* scalable outbound command dispatching
* inbound data rendered by specialized widgets on fly-ins (example: code is rendered in syntax highlighed text editor)
* real time feeds, connected by chat fabric, p2p direct data stream from source <--> sinks into UI widget(s) on fly-ins
* modular, non-intrusive, integration with the mainstream Rocket.Chat core
* bots backwards compatible with Rocket.Chat core
* extension is per-room customizable, for example: one room for open source project Rocket.Chat developers via github integration, another for MineCraft server farms operators discussion and network monitoring, yet another for a drone delivery service's fleet monitoring and control (see screenshot below)
